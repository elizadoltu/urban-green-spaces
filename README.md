# Urban Green Spaces - Full Stack App Experiment

> This project is an experiment with a full-stack web application generated using ChatGPT. The application, named "Urban Green Spaces," aims to showcase urban green spaces, gardening tips, community stories, and more.

## Experiment Objective

> The objective of this experiment was to determine whether an AI model like ChatGPT could generate a functional full-stack application from scratch. ChatGPT was used to generate the initial codebase, including backend routes, database schemas, and frontend components.

## Current Status

> At its current stage, the generated application includes basic functionality such as:
> - Backend API endpoints for articles and stories
> - MongoDB database integration
> - Frontend components for displaying articles and stories

## Future Development

> The generated application will be further developed and transformed into a beautiful and fully functional full-stack application. Planned enhancements and features include:
> - Implementing additional frontend components for better user experience
> - Adding user authentication and authorization
> - Enhancing the database schema to support more complex data structures
> - Integrating third-party APIs for additional functionality
> - Improving overall design and aesthetics

## Note on Development

> The application will be fully developed by myself, and ChatGPT only generated the basic codebase. After a certain point, ChatGPT was unable to generate additional features or complexity.

## Initial Commit

> The first ever commit in this repository represents the code that was generated using ChatGPT. Subsequent commits will contain the code that I write.
